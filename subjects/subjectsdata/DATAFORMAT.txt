The files are named "ResultsSaccades_Subjectname_blkX.mat". 
The block number is given by the X after "blk" in the filename. A Block consists
of a certain set of trials. Files with the same block number consist
of the same set of trials (with the same objects and target for each
trial), but in randomized order, and with randomized object position
for each presentation. See below for details.

Some of the files
have a "2" after the subject's name, which indicates that the same
subject has gone through a second session, in which the same trials
were shown (but in a different order and randomized object position
for each trial).

I have also included the image files for the objects, as well as one
image showing the array of objects shown for trial 1 of block 1
(arraySub_blk1_num1.png).

Each of the data files contains several variables. Some indicate
experimental parameters. However, the main data is the "results" cell
array, which
contains 440 records - one per trial. Each record contains the data
for this particular trial, that is, the objects shown, target,
fixation data, etc.


The format is as follows (using file ResultsSaccades_HC_blk10.mat as
an example):

>> results{1}
ans =
            probes: [32 25 23 37 27 8]

            target: 23

         targetpos: 3

    fixatedobjects: [4 5 6 1 3]

    fixationstarts: [0.2286 0.4937 0.7147 0.9059 1.0943]

      fixationends: [0.4856 0.7019 0.8978 1.0736]

        timetofind: 1.0945

         oldnumber: 200

"probes"contains the IDs of the 6 objects shown in this trial. The PNG
images of these objects are contained in the directory. The objects in
"probes" are arranged in the clockwise order of their screen position:
the first ID is the object located at position 30deg, the second
object is the one at position 90deg, etc. in increments of 60 degrees.

"target" is the ID of the target object. In target-present trials,
this will be a member of the "probes" array"; in target-absent trials,
it won't.

"targetpos" is a number from 1 to 6 indicating the position of the
target object within the probe array, and therefore on screen. In
target-absent trials, this is set to -10, which is a way to identify
target-absent trials.

"fixatedobjects" is an array of numbers from 1 to 6 indicating
positions of the objects that were fixated by the subject, in order of
fixation. In this case the subject first looked at position 4
(150deg), then at position 3 (120deg), then at position 2 (90deg, i.e.
"full East"). NOTE: there can be repetitions in fixatedobjects, if an
object is fixated several times.

"fixationstarts" and "fixationends" contain the starting and ending
time of each successive fixation (i.e. when the subject's gaze entered
and left the object's bounding box area), in seconds.

"timetofind" indicates how long it took the subject to locate the
target., in seconds. If the subject never fixated the target
(including, but not only, in target-absent trials), this is set to -1.

"oldnumber" is the actual "trial number" of this trial, i.e. a unique trial ID
given to each trial in the block. Remember that trial order is randomized for
each presentation of a given block. For example,
ResultsSaccades_Wendy_blk10.mat and ResultsSaccades_HC_blk10.mat contain the
same trials, but in different order; thus results{1} contain a different trial
(i.e. a different set of presented objects and target) in both files. However,
looking at the "oldnumber" value, you can determine which trial each entry in
results corresponds to.  For example, results{1} in
ResultsSaccades_HC_blk10.mat  has oldnumber=200. In
ResultsSaccades_Wendy_blk10.mat , we see that results{404} has the same
oldnumber - and indeed results{1} in the first file has the same objects and
target as results{404} in the second file (though with different spatial
position).


Note that the 'sequence' array in each data file also contains the real trial
ID/oldnumber of each successive trial, in the order shown for this session. So
results{find(sequence==X)} should return you the trial with trial ID X, in any
file containing data from a given block.
